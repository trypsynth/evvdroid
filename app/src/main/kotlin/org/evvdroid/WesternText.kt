 * Android text turned into the Windows Western bytes the engine reads.
 *
 * The engine takes single bytes in the language's own code set, which for
 * every language IBM shipped is the Windows Western set. UTF-16 is not an
 * option here: the engine allows the wide code set only for Chinese, Japanese
 * and Korean, and asking for it in English gets the text read as bytes and
 * stopped at the first high byte, which is one character of speech.
 *
 * So anything outside that set has to become something inside it before the
 * engine sees it. A screen reader is handed curly quotes, dashes, emoji and
 * names in scripts Eloquence never knew, and dropping them silently is worse
 * than saying the nearest thing.
 *
 * The two languages that read something else are [EngineText]'s business, and
 * [flatten] is the half of this they still want.
